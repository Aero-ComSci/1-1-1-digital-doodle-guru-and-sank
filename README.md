The app asks the uesr to take a picture, and once they take a picture it is displayed on the screen. Then, the user can choose different buttons to change the color of the pen and drag across the image to draw on it. There are also buttons to add sunglasses or a mustache. These can be dragged around the image, too. Finally, the user can shake the device to clear all drawings.
